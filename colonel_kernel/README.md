So you have read all about reading images. We have extracted all sorts of channels and colors from them.
The real question is whether you can put those puppy eyes and snapchat filters on your images
Well, that is a bit more complicated but we can learn how to create our custom filters.

So let's dive in.

In image processing, a kernel, convolution matrix, or mask is a small matrix. It is used for blurring, sharpening, embossing, edge detection, and more. This is accomplished by doing a convolution between a kernel and an image.
Convolution is the process of adding each element of the image to its local neighbors, weighted by the kernel.

	for each image row in input image:
	   for each pixel in image row:

	      set accumulator to zero

	      for each kernel row in kernel:
	         for each element in kernel row:

	            if element position  corresponding* to pixel position then
	               multiply element value  corresponding* to pixel value
	               add result to accumulator
	            endif

	      set output image pixel to accumulator

1. Let us first explore the code from [basic_convolutional.py](https://github.com/ritwikraha/Introduction-to-Image-Processing/blob/master/colonel_kernel/basic_convolutional.py) to understand how kernels work.
2. We don't need to know define custom kernels everytime let's  go through [opencv_filters.py](https://github.com/ritwikraha/Introduction-to-Image-Processing/blob/master/colonel_kernel/opencv_filters.py) to learn more
3. There are even more custom filters from ImageFilter module, I've demonstrated one of them in [PIL_FILTERS.py](https://github.com/ritwikraha/Introduction-to-Image-Processing/blob/master/colonel_kernel/PIL_filters.py)
