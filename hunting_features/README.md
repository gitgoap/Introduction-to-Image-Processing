## Hunting Features

Now that we know how to filter our images with the help of custom filters, it is time to level up the game. The next step is to find out if we can extract useful information from our images.

So let's start!

We begin with the very basics of course:

1. Thresholding, is the simplest form of image segmentation. We can start by taking a grayscale image and convert it into a binary vector artwork! [Find out how](https://github.com/ritwikraha/Introduction-to-Image-Processing/blob/master/hunting_features/thresholding.py)

2. Now that we know the basics of image segmentation, let's move on to morpholgical operations on images.Mathematical morphology is useful in analysing geometrical structures based on set theory, and topology.Yep! We can [apply](https://github.com/ritwikraha/Introduction-to-Image-Processing/blob/master/hunting_features/morph_operators.py) them on images too.

3. Those are all very good, but where are all the features? What will help us to detect objects and understand the features of images? Let's have a look at [finding derivatives](https://github.com/ritwikraha/Introduction-to-Image-Processing/blob/master/hunting_features/image_derivative.py) of an image.

4. What if you are interested in finding the features. Or if you can achieve desired results without using all the pixels and corners are sufficient features. Let's have a look at [finding corners in a given image](https://github.com/ayulockin/Introduction-to-Image-Processing/blob/master/hunting_features/cornerDetection.py).
